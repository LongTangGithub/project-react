/**
 * Hooks
 * 
 * Hooks are a new feature in React 16.8 that allows you to use state 
 * and other React features without writing a class.
 * 
 * Previously, we had to use classes to manage state and lifecycle methods.
 * 
 * There are 2 rules for using hooks:
 * 1. Only call hooks at the top level of your component
 * 2. Only call hooks from functional components
 * 
 * Hooks are simple JS functions that allow you to start with the `use` prefix.
 * They can't be used inside of classes,loops, if statements, and nested functions.
 * If a hook needs to be used within a function, we need to turn that function into a custom hook.
 * Hooks can be used in another custom hook.
 * 
 * There are 2 types of hooks:
 * 1. State Hooks: useState
 * 2. Effect Hooks: useEffect
 * 
 * Custom hooks are a way to reuse state logic between components.
 * 
 * Functional components are very light weight and can be enhanced with hooks
 * 
 * Hooks also allow us to encapsulate logic and reuse components logic across
 * different components
 *
